yorick for Debian
-----------------

This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of the `yorick'
interpreted language by David H. Munro.

This package was put together by David H. Munro <munro1@llnl.gov>
from the sources at ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/Yorick/yorick-1.5.08.tgz.

The only changes in this package are the addition of support for the
Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding the debian/ directory.
