Authors & copyright for specific files:

David H. Munro wrote Yorick and Gist.

Individual files were contributed by Éric Thiébaut (e.g. i/fits.i), François
Rigaut (e.g. i/pkg_mngr.i), Bert Still (mpy/).
i/fits.i is Copyright (c) 2000-2002 Eric THIEBAUT

Berkeley Yacc (byacc) generated the Yorick parser.

The routines in matrix/ and fft/ contain C translations by David H. Munro from
LAPACK and FFTPACK.  The algorithms for Yorick's random number generator and
several special functions were taken from Numerical Recipes by Press, et. al.,
although the Yorick implementations are unrelated to those in Numerical
Recipes.

i/idlsave.i in the upstream source derivates from work by Craig Markwardt. It
  is not included in the Debian package due to copyright issues. For the time
  being, extract it from the upstream source if needed.

The the content of the upstream `opengl' directory may not be DFSG-free as it
uses GLX. It is not used and is removed from the Debian source tree. For
OpenGL support, look at yorick-gl in non-free.
