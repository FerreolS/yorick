Description: interpreted language and scientific graphics
 Yorick is an interpreted programming language for:
  * scientific simulations or calculations
  * postprocessing or steering large simulation codes
  * interactive scientific graphics
  * reading, writing, and translating large files of numbers
 .
 The language features a compact syntax for many common array
 operations, so it processes large arrays of numbers very quickly and
 efficiently.  Superficially, yorick code resembles C code, but yorick
 variables are never explicitly declared and have a dynamic scoping
 similar to many Lisp dialects.  The yorick language is designed to be
 typed interactively at a keyboard, as well as stored in files for
 later use.
 .
 This package includes an emacs-based development environment, which
 you can launch by typing M-x yorick in emacs.

Description: interpreted library for the Yorick language
 Yorick is an interpreted programming language for:
  * scientific simulations or calculations

 This convenience package contains nothing in itself but depends on Yorick and
 all add-on packages in Debian as of writing (the packages in non-free are
 suggested, not depended upon).

 The Yorick package ships with little documentation: a manpage, the
 Yorick Manual in info format, and its own "help" command. This
 package adds the Yorick Manual and Quick Reference in PDF and HTML
 format and a utility (update-yorickdoc) to build HTML documentation
 for the set of functions (from Yorick and add-on packages) installed
 on this machine. By default, these pages are built and updated
 automatically whenever necessary.
 .
 Once this package is installed, simply point your preferred web
 browser to file:///usr/share/doc/yorick-doc/README.html .
